# **[FeeFree](https://app.feefree.fi/)**

## **Background**

In the Ethereum ecosystem, Uniswap is the leading DEX, but it charges fees ranging from 0.01% to 1% on LPs, which has increased transaction costs and hindered the rapid development of the ecosystem. This has also limited the accessibility of blockchain technology to a wider audience.

Robinhood has achieved tremendous success in the United States, with over 30 million active users. Their core strategy of offering commission-free trading has been a major factor contributing to their success. The appeal of free services is undeniable, and this serves as an example for the success of FeeFree.

## **What is FeeFree?**

FeeFree is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that provides a fee-free DeFi experience with zero LP fees. FeeFree aims to minimize gas costs, with each transaction incurring only a nominal flat gas fee per transaction (less than $0.1 per transaction).

## **Goal**

To reach 10,000 active users.

## **How will we achieve this?**

1. Set a zero fee rate for the liquidity pool.
2. Provide initial liquidity through our own funds, seed rounds, and grants.
3. Set a specific lock-up period.
4. Use a portion of the gas fees to reward the initial liquidity providers.
5. Continuously reward liquidity providers with a share of the transaction gas fees received.

## **Roadmap**

The core functions have already been implemented. The following steps will refine the product, enhance the user experience, support more networks, and focus on marketing efforts.

1. April 2024: Launch on the Zora network.
2. May to July 2024: Launch on additional networks and support for more trading pairs.
3. August to December 2024: Integration with other aggregated DEXs.
4. 2025: Launch order book-based DEX and derivatives exchanges, providing a trading experience similar to CEX.

## **Vision**

To build a Robinhood-style DEX in the blockchain industry, enabling participation in DeFi for everyone worldwide!
